# Lesson 1 (FolderCreator)

We have a big company with **200** employees.
Everyone is looking for a personal folder on the server you are currently working on. (your computer)
HR sent you a file with these employees.
You are creating a folder where you are planning to place all of this personal catalogs.

**Rules**
```
1) If person's  first name, for example, "Vasya", and his Surname is "Pupko", his folder should be called "VPupko"
2) You should never edit this file from HR
3) Use only Python (no Bash or Powershell tricks there!)
4) You'll create a folder with a name "Share" and place everything there

```

# Good Luck!
