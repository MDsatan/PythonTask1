# Lesson 1 (FolderCreator)

We have a big company with **200** employees.
Everyone is looking for a personal folder on the server you are currently working on.
HR sent you a file with these employees.

**Rules**
```
1) If person's  first name, for example, ***Vasya***, and his Surname is ***Pupko***, his folder should be called ***VPupko***
2) You should never edit this file from HR
3) Use only Python
```

# Good Luck!
